# Internship Assignment

A todo app with multiple features (Advance todo)

### My approach

I started building the frontend first. After completing the whole frontend. I move into developing the add Todo section. After completing this, I moved into the filter section.

**(Note: for now I have given only filter by priority feature)**

After all of this, I moved into building the drag and drop feature. **(I didn't used any library for this)**

After this, I deployed the whole code to vercel

### Assumptions

I developed the features, which are asked to developed. Except from that, I didn't maked any assumptions I guess.

### Setup Locally

To setup the project locally follow the below steps:

- Clone the repository into your local system by the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ronak-pal1/Advance-Todo.git
```

- After cloneing the repo, go into the folder and install the dependencies by the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

- Now to run the project locally, enter the following command

```sh
npm run dev
```

- You can see the project on the local port 5173 (most probably). So, now go to the URL http://localhost:5173

Thank you :)
